## Mastering Hybrid Work: A Practical Guide for Software Engineers

Welcome to the repository for the paper "Mastering Hybrid Work: A Practical Guide for Software Engineers," submitted to SBES 2024, the XXXVIII Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering. This repository is part of our commitment to the Open Science policies encouraged by SBES 2024, aiming to enhance transparency, replicability, and reproducibility in research.

### Abstract

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, hybrid software development teams have notably gained prominence. The coordination of these teams, however, poses many challenges, particularly around effective communication, the setup of a good working environment, and cooperative practices. To address these issues, we conducted a study in collaboration with the IT department of a Brazilian multinational company, structured into three stages: (1) a multivocal literature review, (2) a case study with discursive textual analysis through semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation, and (3) a focus group for the development of a guide on collaborative practices. This study engaged 11 software engineers across eight teams and resulted in 23 practices categorized into three dimensions: people, processes, and spaces. These practices are designed to enhance the management of hybrid teams and contribute to the broader understanding of hybrid work dynamics in software development.

### Repository Content

This repository includes:
- **Data and Artifacts**: All relevant data and artifacts generated during our research are available here. Due to the collaborative nature of our work and the sensitivity of some data, specific items have been anonymized to maintain confidentiality and comply with ethical standards.
- **Practices Guide**: The guide developed from our focus group discussions, outlining effective practices for managing hybrid software development teams.
- **Supplementary Materials**: Additional resources and materials that support the findings and methodologies used in our study.

### Artefact Availability

As per the Open Science policy of SBES 2024, we have included a section in our paper titled "Artefact Availability." This section provides:
- Links to download or access all relevant research artifacts.
- Instructions on how to use these artifacts to replicate or extend our study findings.

If certain data or artifacts are not available for public access, a detailed explanation has been provided in the paper, outlining the reasons based on the ethical considerations or the proprietary nature of the information.

### Contact Information

For any inquiries regarding the research or difficulties in accessing the artifacts, please refer to the "Artefact Availability" section of our paper, where you can find the contact details of the Open Science Coordinators for SBES 2024 without compromising the anonymization required during the review phase.

### Contributing

We encourage the community to engage with our research by using our data and practices guide. Feedback and contributions to enhance the artifacts or to discuss potential collaboration are highly appreciated.

Thank you for visiting our repository, and we hope our research contributes valuable insights and practical tools for managing hybrid software development teams effectively.
